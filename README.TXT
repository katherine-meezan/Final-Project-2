This project was created by me (Katherine Meezan) and Cara Razma as a final project for our first Semester of AP Computer Science A.
We had a few weeks to work on it in class, and were tasked with making a game that would display our Java knowledge up to that point.

It runs as a text-based tower escape game, where the player has to navigate a tower full of monsters in order to find the keys to escape.
